# On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. 
# However, you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the same day, ensuring you never hold more than one share of the stock.

    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        maximum_profit=0
        
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):

            if prices[i-1]<prices[i]:
                maximum_profit+=prices[i]-prices[i-1]
        return maximum_profit
